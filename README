Google-ProtoBuf version 0.01
============================

Google Protocol Buffers is a data serialization format. 
It is binary (and hence compact and fast for serialization) 
and as extendable as XML; its nearest analogues are Thrift and ASN.1.
There are official mappings for C++, Java and Python languages; 
this library is a mapping for Perl.
